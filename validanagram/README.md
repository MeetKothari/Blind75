This code checks if two words are made up of the same letters but in a different order. It does this by counting the number of times each letter appears in each word, and then comparing these counts to see if they are the same.

First, the code checks if the two words are the same length. If they are not, then they cannot be made up of the same letters and the code returns "false".

Then, the code creates a list of 26 numbers, one for each letter of the alphabet. This is like a special box that keeps track of how many times each letter appears in the two words.

The code then goes through each letter in both words, and adds 1 to the box for each letter in the first word, and subtracts 1 from the box for each letter in the second word. This way, the box keeps track of the difference in the number of times each letter appears in the two words.

Finally, the code goes through the box to see if all the numbers in the box are 0. If they are, then that means that the two words have the same letters in them, just in a different order. If any of the numbers are not 0, then the two words are not made up of the same letters and the code returns "false". If all the numbers are 0, then the code returns "true".

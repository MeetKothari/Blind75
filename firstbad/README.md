I like to think about it from a top-down POV, first.

Imagine you have a bunch of toys lined up in a row, with numbers on them from 1 to 100. You know that one of the toys (let's call it the "broken" toy) is not working properly, but you don't know which one it is.

Your job is to find the broken toy as quickly as possible. To do this, you can use a special machine that you can ask about any toy to find out whether it's broken or not. You want to ask as few questions as possible to figure out which toy is broken.

The first thing you might do is pick a toy in the middle of the row (let's say toy number 50) and ask the machine if it's broken. If the machine says it's broken, then you know that the broken toy must be somewhere in the first half of the row (toys 1-49). If the machine says it's not broken, then you know that the broken toy must be somewhere in the second half of the row (toys 51-100).

You can repeat this process, picking the middle toy of the remaining row each time and asking the machine if it's broken. Each time, you can eliminate half of the remaining toys as possibilities based on the machine's answer.

Eventually, you'll be left with just one toy, which must be the broken one. By using this strategy of dividing the possibilities in half each time, you can find the broken toy with the fewest possible questions to the machine.

That's basically what the "first bad version" problem is all about: finding the broken toy (or bad version) as quickly as possible by dividing the possibilities in half each time.

The algorithm works as follows:

- We start by setting the left endpoint of the range of versions we're searching to 1 (the first version) and the right endpoint to n (the last version).

- We then enter a loop that continues until we've narrowed the range down to a single version. Inside the loop, we compute the midpoint of the remaining range using the formula mid = left + (right - left) / 2. This formula ensures that mid is always rounded down to the nearest integer.

- We then call the isBadVersion function on the mid version to determine whether it's a bad version or not. If it is a bad version, we know that the first bad version must be in the left half of the remaining range, so we narrow the range to the left half by setting right = mid. If it's not a bad version, we know that the first bad version must be in the right half of the remaining range, so we narrow the range to the right half by setting left = mid + 1.

- We repeat this process until we've narrowed the range down to a single version. At this point, we know that this version must be the first bad version, so we return it.

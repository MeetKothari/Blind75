The flood fill algorithm is like painting on a coloring book. Imagine you have a picture with lots of little areas, and each area is a different color. You want to color in one of the areas with a new color, but you want to make sure you only color inside that area and not spill over into any of the other areas.

To do this, you start by finding the color of the area you want to color in. Then you start at one point in that area and start coloring in that point with the new color. Then you look at the neighboring points (the points directly above, below, to the left, and to the right of the current point), and color them in too, as long as they're the same color as the point you're currently coloring. You keep doing this for all the neighboring points until you've colored in the whole area.

That's basically what the flood fill algorithm does - it colors in a connected region of pixels in an image with a new color.

---

- First, we start with the initial pixel (sr, sc) that we want to fill. We also have a new color that we want to use to fill this region.

- We get the color of the initial pixel (sr, sc). If it's already the same as the new color, we don't need to do anything and we can just return the original image.

- Otherwise, we call a recursive helper function called "fill" that will do the actual flood fill.

- The "fill" function takes the image, the row and column of the current pixel, the old color we're replacing, and the new color we're filling with.

- First, we check if the current pixel is out of bounds (i.e. if it's outside the image) or if it's not the same color as the old color we're replacing. If either of these conditions is true, we stop and return without doing anything.

- Otherwise, we set the current pixel to the new color we're filling with.

- Then, we call the "fill" function recursively for each neighboring pixel (up, down, left, and right) that has the same color as the old color. This will continue the flood fill until the entire region of pixels with the old color has been replaced with the new color.

- Once the "fill" function is done, we can return the modified image with the entire region filled with the new color.

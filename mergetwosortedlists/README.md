This solution iteratively compares the values of the nodes in the two input linked lists and adds the smaller value to the merged list. The current pointer is then moved to the next node in the merged list. Once one of the input linked lists is fully traversed, the remaining nodes of the other linked list are appended to the end of the merged list. Finally, the merged list is returned, excluding the initial dummy node. This solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the total number of nodes in both input linked lists, and a space complexity of O(1), as it modifies the input linked lists in place and only uses a constant amount of extra space.

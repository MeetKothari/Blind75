A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same backward and forward. For example, "racecar" and "A man, a plan, a canal, Panama" are palindromes.

To check if a given string is a valid palindrome, we can follow these steps:

- Remove any non-alphanumeric characters (such as spaces, punctuation, and symbols) from the string.
- Convert the string to lowercase (or uppercase) to make the comparison case-insensitive.
- Compare the first character in the string with the last character, the second character with the second-to-last character, and so on, until we reach the middle of the string.
- If all the corresponding characters match, the string is a valid palindrome. If any of the corresponding characters don't match, the string is not a valid palindrome.

The solution I provided uses a more efficient way to perform step 3. It uses two pointers, one at the start of the string and one at the end, and compares the characters at these two positions. If the characters don't match, the string is not a valid palindrome. If they do match, it moves both pointers one position closer to the middle of the string and repeats the comparison until the pointers meet in the middle.

The solution also skips over any non-alphanumeric characters in the string, as these don't affect whether the string is a palindrome or not.

## We create a stack to store the opening parentheses, braces, and brackets that we encounter in the string.

## We iterate through the string from left to right, examining each character.

## If we encounter an opening parentheses, brace, or bracket, we push it onto the stack.

## If we encounter a closing parentheses, brace, or bracket, we check if it matches the top element of the stack. If it does, we pop the top element of the stack. If it doesn't, we know that the string is not balanced and we return false.

## If we iterate through the whole string and the stack is empty, we know that the string is balanced and we return true. Otherwise, we return false.

# The time complexity of this solution is O(n) because we traverse the string once and perform constant-time operations for each character. The space complexity is also O(n) because in the worst case, we need to store all opening parentheses, braces, and brackets on the stack.

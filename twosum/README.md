# The solution for TwoSum is quite trivial, though it echoes concepts in programming that will undoubtedly show up as I get further down this list.
## First off, the basics. The time complexity of this solution is O(n) because we traverse the array of numbers once, and for each element, we perform a constant-time operation of checking if its complement is already in the map or adding the element and its index to the map.

## Here's how this solution works:

## - We create a hash map to store the values of the input array as keys and their indices as values.
## - We iterate through the input array from left to right.
## - For each element, we calculate its complement (i.e., the difference between the target value and the current element).
## - We check if the complement is already in the hash map. If it is, we have found a pair of elements that add up to the target, so we return their indices as an array.
## - If the complement is not in the hash map, we add the current element and its index to the hash map.
## - If we iterate through the whole array and don't find a pair of elements that add up to the target, we throw an exception.

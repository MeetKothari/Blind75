Imagine that you're a stock trader and you're trying to make a profit by buying and selling a particular stock. You have a record of the stock's price every day, and you want to figure out the best time to buy and sell it in order to make the most money.

To do this, you need to look at the record of prices and find the lowest price that occurs before the highest price. That way, you can buy the stock when it's cheap and sell it when it's expensive.

The algorithm for finding the best time to buy and sell the stock goes like this:

- Look at the price on the first day.
- Assume that this is the lowest price you've seen so far.
- Look at the price on the next day.
- If the price on the next day is lower than the current lowest price, update the current lowest price to be the price on the next day.
- If the price on the next day is higher than the current lowest price, calculate the difference between the price on the next day and the current lowest price.
- If this difference is bigger than any previous differences you've calculated, update your record of the biggest difference.
- Repeat steps 3-6 for all the remaining days in the record.
- Return the biggest difference you've found.
This algorithm finds the best time to buy and sell the stock in a single pass through the record of prices. It takes into account the fact that you can't sell the stock before you buy it, and that you can only buy it once and sell it once.
